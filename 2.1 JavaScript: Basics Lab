2.1 JavaScript: Basics Lab

PART 1

What are the data types of the following?
1.    var foo = “bar”; a variable is being assigned to a string
2.    var bar = 231; a number
3.    var boo = false; primitive data types
4.    var aoo = “true”; a string
5.    var oar = “5321.31”; string
6.    var hoo; undefined
7.    var tree = {family:“evergreen”, name:“pine”}; complex object

PART 2

Which of the following is not valid?
A.    var x = 3, y = 4, z = “there”, a = “true”; this one is wrong, You cant combine strings with numbers
B.    var w = “number:” + 7 
C.    var okay;
Okay = 5;

PART 3

Create a function that takes in a number (called num) and string (called noun). Then returns the square of the number concatenated with the string. Ex: calling my_func(4, “hi”) returns 16 hi
function squareNumber(num, noun){
  
  let squareNumber = num * num + " " + noun;
  return squareNumber;
  
}
squareNumber(97, "McDonalds");
"9409 McDonalds"
PART 4

Go through the function. What will text contain?
var mylist = [1, “David”, “Julia”, 21, “Gina”, 932, 53, 0, “Sean”]
var text = “”;
var x;
for (x in mylist) {
if (x === “David”) { continue; }
if (x === 53) {break;}
text += x + “,”;
}
// the text will contain 1, Julia, 21, Gina, 923
